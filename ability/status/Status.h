//Status include Buff, Debuff, Passive Ability, and level up bonus
//It has ability nodes as Ability, but the effects are triggered by some event or time point

//Event can be a enum, such as Level up, Turn Start, Tile Change....
//Status should register some of the event to something high level
//when any of the event occurs, high level class should notify this
//and this should do something based on which event occur.

//EXAMPLE: Demonic Restriction will handle Tile Change event
//if it's not Demonic Presence Tile, its effect will activate
//otherwise deactivate

//EXAMPLE: a "Until next turn" Status will handle Turn Start event
//it will decrease duration by 1 and see if it's zero
//then decide to remove this effect
